# How I Unlocked More TikTok Content from Different Regions Using 9Proxy

I love scrolling through TikTok, but I noticed that some of the coolest videos and trends only show up in certain countries. It was annoying because I wanted to see what was trending globally, not just in my region. TikTok limits content based on your IP address, so you end up stuck with the local feed most of the time.

Then I started using [9Proxy](https://9proxy.com/?utm_source=web20&utm_id=donne123).
